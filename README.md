# FileServerWithGo

To serve and access files from a specific folder in your local Go project, you should create a directory for your static files (e.g., "static") within your project directory. Then, you can use Go's built-in HTTP server to serve these files locally.

Here are the steps to serve and access files from a local folder in your Go project:

Create a "static" folder in your Go project directory. Place your static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) inside this folder.

Use the http.FileServer handler to serve the files from the "static" folder. You can create a simple web server to serve these files. Here's an example:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static")) // Serve files from the "static" directory
    http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fs))

    // Start the HTTP server on a specific port (e.g., 8080)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
In this example, the http.Dir("static") function specifies the directory to serve files from, and the http.Handle function associates it with the "/static/" URL path.

Run your Go program. Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run your Go program using the go run command or build and execute it.

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
Now, your local server is running, and you can access the files from the "static" folder in your browser by visiting URLs like "http://localhost:8080/static/yourfile.html," where "yourfile.html" is the name of the static file you want to access.

Make sure to replace "yourfile.html" with the actual name of the static file you want to access. This approach allows you to serve and access static files locally using Go's built-in HTTP server.
